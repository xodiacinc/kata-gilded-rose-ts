# [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

This version of the Gilded Rose refactoring kata is based on the version written by emily Bache (link in the title).
It was created to have the requirements entirely expressed at Jest tests so that participants can focus on the refactoring.

To run the tests, use:

> ```npm test```

## How do practice this kata?

1. Refactor the code to be able to add functionality for conjured item
2. Remove the exclusion of the test suite _Conjured Item_ and exclude the golden master test
3. Make all tests pass

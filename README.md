# [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

This version of the Gilded Rose refactoring kata is based on the version written by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).
It was created to have the requirements entirely expressed at Jest tests so that participants can focus on the refactoring.

To run the tests, use:

> ```npm test```

## How to practice this kata?

1. Refactor the code to prepare for adding conjured item
2. Include the test suite _Conjured Item_ and exclude the golden master test
3. Make all tests pass by adding support for conjured item
